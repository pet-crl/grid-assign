              <p class="description">  "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to 
               make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
               I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
               The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, 
               I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p class="quote">Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended</p>
        <p class="description">"Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve 
         never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
         professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I 
         was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only 
         say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
         did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long 
         for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
         It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
         In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
         It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
         100% recommend! ”</p>

        <p class="quote">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves</p>
        <p class="description"> 
         “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
         The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present 
         myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal 
         attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
